                <h2>What Are Society and Culture?</h2>

                <p>Sociology is the scientific and systematic study of groups and group interactions, societies and
                    social interactions,
                    from small and personal groups to very large groups. A group of people who live in a defined
                    geographic area, who
                    interact with one another, and who share a common culture is what sociologists call a society.</p>

                <p>Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society. Sociologists working from the micro-level study
                    small groups and
                    individual interactions, while those using macro-level analysis look at trends among and between
                    large groups and
                    societies. For example, a micro-level study might look at the accepted rules of conversation in
                    various groups such as
                    among teenagers or business professionals. In contrast, a macro-level analysis might research the
                    ways that language use
                    has changed over time or in social media outlets.</p>

                <p>Sociologists often study culture using the sociological imagination, which pioneer sociologist C.
                    Wright Mills described
                    as an awareness of the relationship between a person’s behavior and experience and the wider culture
                    that shaped the
                    person’s choices and perceptions. It’s a way of seeing our own and other people’s behavior in
                    relationship to history
                    and social structure (1959). One illustration of this is a person’s decision to marry. In the United
                    States, this choice
                    is heavily influenced by individual feelings. However, the social acceptability of marriage relative
                    to the person’s
                    circumstances also plays a part.</p>

                <p>Remember, though, that culture is a product of the people in a society. Sociologists take care not to
                    treat the concept
                    of “culture” as though it were alive and real. The error of treating an abstract concept as though
                    it has a real,
                    material existence is known as reification (Sahn, 2013).</p>

                <h2>How Sociologists View Society</h2>

                <p>All sociologists are interested in the experiences of individuals and how those experiences are
                    shaped by interactions
                    with social groups and society. To a sociologist, the personal decisions an individual makes do not
                    exist in a vacuum.
                    Cultural patterns, social forces and influences put pressure on people to select one choice over
                    another. Sociologists
                    try to identify these general patterns by examining the behavior of large groups of people living in
                    the same society
                    and experiencing the same societal pressures.</p>

                <p>Consider the changes in U.S. families. The “typical” family in past decades consisted of married
                    parents living in a
                    home with their unmarried children. Today, the percent of unmarried couples, same-sex couples,
                    single-parent and
                    single-adult households is increasing, as well as is the number of expanded households, in which
                    extended family members
                    such as grandparents, cousins, or adult children live together in the family home. While 15 million
                    mothers still make
                    up the majority of single parents, 3.5 million fathers are also raising their children alone (U.S.
                    Census Bureau, 2020).
                    Increasingly, single people and cohabitating couples are choosing to raise children outside of
                    marriage through
                    surrogates or adoption.</p>

                <p>Some sociologists study social facts—the laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs, fashions,
                    rituals, and
                    cultural rules that govern social life—that may contribute to these changes in the family. Do people
                    in the United
                    States view marriage and family differently over the years? Do they view them differently than
                    Peruvians? Do employment
                    and economic conditions play a role in families? Other sociologists are studying the consequences of
                    these new patterns,
                    such as the ways children influence and are influenced by them and/or the changing needs for
                    education, housing, and
                    healthcare.</p>

                <h2>Sociology in the Real World</h2>
                <h3>Individual-Society Connections</h3>

                <p>When sociologist Nathan Kierns spoke to his friend Ashley (a pseudonym) about the move she and her
                    partner had made from
                    an urban center to a small Midwestern town, he was curious about how the social pressures placed on
                    a lesbian couple
                    differed from one community to the other. Ashley said that in the city they had been accustomed to
                    getting looks and
                    hearing comments when she and her partner walked hand in hand. Otherwise, she felt that they were at
                    least being
                    tolerated. There had been little to no outright discrimination.</p>

                <p>Things changed when they moved to the small town for her partner’s job. For the first time, Ashley
                    found herself
                    experiencing direct discrimination because of her sexual orientation. Some of it was particularly
                    hurtful. Landlords
                    would not rent to them. Ashley, who is a highly trained professional, had a great deal of difficulty
                    finding a new job.</p>

                <p>When Nathan asked Ashley if she and her partner became discouraged or bitter about this new
                    situation, Ashley said that
                    rather than letting it get to them, they decided to do something about it. Ashley approached groups
                    at a local college
                    and several churches in the area. Together they decided to form the town's first Gay-Straight
                    Alliance.</p>

                <p>The alliance has worked successfully to educate their community about same-sex couples. It also
                    worked to raise awareness about the kinds of discrimination that Ashley and her partner experienced in the town and
                    how those could be eliminated. The alliance has become a strong advocacy group, and it is working to attain equal
                    rights for lesbian, gay,bisexual, and transgender, or LGBTQ individuals.Kierns observed that this is an excellent example of
                    how negative social forces can result in a positive response from
                    individuals to bring about social change (Kierns, 2011).</p>
