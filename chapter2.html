                <h2>The History of Sociology</h2>

                <p>For millennia, people have been fascinated by the relationships between individuals and societies. Many topics studied
                by ancient philosophers in their desire to describe an ideal society are still studied in modern sociology, including
                theories of social conflict, economics, social cohesion, and power in a continued attempt to describe an ideal society
                (Hannoum, 2003). Although we are more familiar with western philosophers like Plato and his student, Aristotle, eastern
                philosophers also thought about social issues.</p>

                <p>Until recently, we have very few texts that are non-religious in nature that theorize about social life. From 4th
                century through the 19th century, the Catholic Church was the seat of power from today’s Turkey in the east to western
                and northern Europe, including the British Isles. Only monks who were charged with rewriting holy texts by hand and the
                aristocracy were literate. Moreover, the Church consolidated power. In the year 800, Pope Leo III named Charlemagne, the
                king of Francia (today’s France, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany) emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, giving one
                individual control over most of Europe. Doing so gave the Catholic Church the power to maintain its own traditions
                safeguard them from the influence of people practicing other religions. If any social patterns challenged any belief of
                the Church, those practitioners were massacred, burned at the stake, or labeled heretics. As a result, the records that
                we have are extremely subjective and do not offer an unbiased view of social practice.</p>

                <p>In the 13th century, Ma Tuan-Lin, a Chinese historian, was the first to record, in his seminal encyclopedia titled
                General Study of Literary Remains, the social dynamics underlying and generating historical development.</p>

                <p>In the 18th century, Enlightenment philosophers developed general principles that could be used to explain social life.
                Thinkers such as John Locke, François-Marie Arouet (Voltaire), Immanuel Kant, and Thomas Hobbes responded to what they
                saw as social ills by writing on topics that they hoped would lead to social reform. Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797)
                wrote about women’s conditions in society. Like Harriet Martineau and Jane Addams, her works were long ignored by the
                male academic structure, but since the 1970s, Wollstonecraft has been widely considered the first feminist thinker of
                consequence. Ideas about economic systems, the family, health and hygiene, national offense and defense, were among the
                many concerns of social life.</p>

                <p>The early 19th century saw great changes with the Industrial Revolution, increased mobility, and new kinds of
                employment. It was also a period of increased trade, travel, and globalization that exposed many people — for the first
                time—to societies and cultures other than their own. Millions of people moved into cities and many people turned away
                from their traditional religious beliefs. Ideas spread rapidly, groups were created, political decisions became public
                decisions. Among a new generation of philosophers, there were some who believed they could make sense of it all.</p>

                <h2>Creating a Discipline: European Theorists</h2>
                <h3>Auguste Comte (1798 – 1857)</h3>

                <p>The term sociology was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès (1748–1836) in an unpublished
                manuscript (Fauré et al. 1999). In 1838, the term was reintroduced by Auguste Comte (1798–1857). Comte originally
                studied to be an engineer, but later became a pupil of social philosopher Claude Henri de Rouvroy Comte de Saint-Simon
                (1760–1825). They both thought that social scientists could study society using the same scientific methods utilized in
                natural sciences. Comte also believed in the potential of social scientists to work toward the betterment of society. He
                held that once scholars identified the laws that governed society, sociologists could address problems such as poor
                education and poverty (Abercrombie et al. 2000).</p>

                <p>Comte named the scientific study of social patterns positivism. He described his philosophy in a series of books called
                The Course in Positive Philosophy (1830–1842) and A General View of Positivism (1848). He believed that revealing the
                laws by which societies and individuals interact would usher in a new “positivist” age of history. While the field and
                its terminology have grown, sociologists still believe in the positive impact of their work.</p>

                <h3>Harriet Martineau (1802 – 1876)</h3>

                <p>Harriet Martineau introduced sociology to English speaking scholars through her translation of Comte’s writing from
                French to English. She was an early analyst of social practices, including economics, social class, religion, suicide,
                government, and women’s rights. Her career began with Illustrations of Political Economy, a work educating ordinary
                people about the principles of economics (Johnson, 2003). She later developed the first systematic methodological
                international comparisons of social institutions in two of her most famous sociological works: Society in America (1837)
                and Retrospect of Western Travel (1838).</p>

                <p>Martineau found the workings of capitalism at odds with the professed moral principles of people in the United States.
                She pointed out the faults with the free enterprise system in which workers were exploited and impoverished while
                business owners became wealthy. She further noted that the belief that all are created equal was inconsistent with the
                lack of women’s rights. Much like Mary Wollstonecraft, Martineau was often discounted in her own time because academic
                sociology was a male-dominated profession.</p>
                
                <h3>Karl Marx (1818-1883)</h3>

                <p>Marx predicted that inequalities of capitalism would become so extreme that workers would eventually revolt. This would
                lead to the collapse of capitalism, which would be replaced by communism. Communism is an economic system under which
                there is no private or corporate ownership: everything is owned communally and distributed as needed. Marx believed that
                communism was a more equitable system than capitalism.</p>

                <h2>Social Policy and Debate</h2>
                <h3>Should We Raise the Minimum Wage?</h3>

                <p>During his hard-fought 2020 campaign, President Joe Biden promised Americans that he would raise the federal minimum
                wage. Opponents of raising the minimum wage argue that some workers would get larger paychecks while others would lose
                their jobs, and companies would be less likely to hire new workers because of the increased cost of paying them. Biden
                and other proponents of raising the minimum wage contend that some job loss would be greatly offset by the positive
                effects on the standard of living of low-wage workers and reducing the income gap between the rich and poor.</p>

                <p>Sociologists may consider the minimum wage issue from differing perspectives as well. How much of an impact would a
                minimum wage raise have for a single mother? Some might study the economic effects, such as her ability to pay bills and
                keep food on the table. Others might look at how reduced economic stress could improve family relationships. Some
                sociologists might research the impact on the status of small business owners. These could all be examples of public
                sociology, a branch of sociology that strives to bring sociological dialogue to public forums. The goals of public
                sociology are to increase understanding of the social factors that underlie social problems and assist in finding
                solutions. According to Michael Burawoy (2005), the challenge of public sociology is to engage multiple publics in
                multiple ways.</p>

                <h3>Applying the Discipline:</h3>

                <p>In the early 1900s, sociology reached universities in the United States. William Sumner held the first professorship in
                sociology (Yale University), Franklin Giddings was the first full professor of Sociology (Columbia University), and
                Albion Small wrote the first sociology textbook. Early American sociologists tested and applied the theories of the
                Europeans and became leaders in social research. Lester Ward (1841 – 1913) developed social research methods and argued
                for the use of the scientific method and quantitative data (Chapter 2) to show the effectiveness of policies. In order
                for sociology to gain respectability in American academia, social researchers understood that they must adopt empirical
                approaches.</p>
