                <h2>Theoretical Perspectives in Sociology</h2>

                <p>Sociologists study social events, interactions, and patterns, and they develop theories to explain why things work as
                they do. In sociology, a theory is a way to explain different aspects of social interactions and to create a testable
                proposition, called a hypothesis, about society (Allan 2006).</p>

                <p>For example, although suicide is generally considered an individual phenomenon, Émile Durkheim was interested in
                studying the social factors that affect it. He studied social solidarity, social ties within a group, and hypothesized
                that differences in suicide rates might be explained by religious differences. Durkheim gathered a large amount of data
                about Europeans and found that Protestants were more likely to commit suicide than Catholics. His work supports the
                utility of theory in sociological research.</p>

                <p>Theories vary in scope depending on the scale of the issues that they are meant to explain. Macro-level theories relate
                to large-scale issues and large groups of people, while micro-level theories look at very specific relationships between
                individuals or small groups. Grand theories attempt to explain large-scale relationships and answer fundamental
                questions such as why societies form and why they change. Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be
                considered complete. Classic sociological theories are still considered important and current, but new sociological
                theories build upon the work of their predecessors and add to them (Calhoun, 2002).</p>

                <p>In sociology, a few theories provide broad perspectives that help explain many different aspects of social life, and
                these are called paradigms. Paradigms are philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate
                theories, generalizations, and the experiments performed in support of them. Three paradigms have come to dominate
                sociological thinking because they provide useful explanations: structural functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic
                interactionism.</p>

                <h2>Conflict Theory</h2>

                <p>Conflict theory looks at society as a competition for limited resources. This perspective is a macro-level approach most
                identified with the writings of German philosopher and economist Karl Marx, who saw society as being made up of
                individuals in different social classes who must compete for social, material, and political resources such as food and
                housing, employment, education, and leisure time. Social institutions like government, education, and religion reflect
                this competition in their inherent inequalities and help maintain the unequal social structure. Some individuals and
                organizations are able to obtain and keep more resources than others, and these “winners” use their power and influence
                to maintain social institutions. The perpetuation of power results in the perpetuation of oppression.</p>

                <p>Several theorists suggested variations on this basic theme like Polish-Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz
                (1838–1909) who expanded on Marx’s ideas by arguing that war and conquest are the bases of civilizations. He believed
                that cultural and ethnic conflicts led to states being identified and defined by a dominant group that had power over
                other groups (Irving, 2007).</p>

                <p>German sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920) agreed with Marx but also believed that, in addition to economic inequalities,
                inequalities of political power and social structure cause conflict. Weber noted that different groups were affected
                differently based on education, race, and gender, and that people’s reactions to inequality were moderated by class
                differences and rates of social mobility, as well as by perceptions about the legitimacy of those in power. A reader of
                Marx, Georg Simmel believed that conflict can help integrate and stabilize a society. He said that the intensity of the
                conflict varies depending on the emotional involvement of the parties, the degree of solidarity within the opposing
                groups, and the clarity and limited nature of the goals. Simmel also showed that groups work to create internal
                solidarity, centralize power, and reduce dissent. The stronger the bond, the weaker the discord. Resolving conflicts can
                reduce tension and hostility and can pave the way for future agreements.</p>

                <h2>Functionalism</h2>

                <p>Functionalism, also called structural-functional theory, sees society as a structure with interrelated parts designed to
                meet the biological and social needs of the individuals in that society. Functionalism grew out of the writings of
                English philosopher and biologist, Herbert Spencer, who saw similarities between society and the human body. He argued
                that just as the various organs of the body work together to keep the body functioning, the various parts of society
                work together to keep society functioning (Spencer, 1898). The parts of society that Spencer referred to were the social
                institutions, or patterns of beliefs and behaviors focused on meeting social needs, such as government, education,
                family, healthcare, religion, and the economy.</p>

                <p>Émile Durkheim applied Spencer’s theory to explain how societies change and survive over time. Durkheim believed that
                society is a complex system of interrelated and interdependent parts that work together to maintain stability (Durkheim,
                1893), and that society is held together by shared values, languages, and symbols. He believed that to study society, a
                sociologist must look beyond individuals to social facts such as laws, morals, values, religious beliefs, customs,
                fashion, and rituals, which all serve to govern social life (Durkheim, 1895). Alfred Radcliff-Brown (1881–1955) defined
                the function of any recurrent activity as the part it played in social life as a whole, and therefore the contribution
                it makes to social stability and continuity (Radcliff-Brown 1952). In a healthy society, all parts work together to
                maintain stability, a state called dynamic equilibrium by later sociologists such as Parsons (1961).</p>

                <p>Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society, but in order to study society, sociologists have to look beyond
                individuals to social facts. . Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society. For example,
                one function of a society’s laws may be to protect society from violence, while another is to punish criminal behavior,
                while another is to preserve public health.</p>
